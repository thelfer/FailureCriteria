The ductility was found to depend markedly both on the orientation of the stress system with respect to the rolling direction and on the tri-axiality of the stress-state. In some cases, ductile failure occurred at plastic strains which were only a few times the yield strain. Metallographic studies have been used to compare the size, shape and orientation of the holes which cause failure initiation with the isotropic continuum analysis of F.A. Mc Clintock (1968). The application of ductile-fracture models to directional steels is discussed with particular reference to the effects of directionality and stress-state on the condition for flow localization to occur between holes.},

	abstract = {The Mohr–Coulomb (M–C) fracture criterion is revisited with an objective of describing ductile fracture of isotropic crack-free solids. This criterion has been extensively used in rock and soil mechanics as it correctly accounts for the effects of hydrostatic pressure as well as the Lode angle parameter. It turns out that these two parameters, which are critical for characterizing fracture of geo-materials, also control fracture of ductile metals (Bai and Wierzbicki 2008; Xue 2007; Barsoum 2006; Wilkins et al. 1980). The local form of the M–C criterion is transformed/extended to the spherical coordinate system, where the axes are the equivalent strain to fracture \$\$\{{\textbackslash}bar {\textbackslash}varepsilon\_f\}\$\$, the stress triaxiality η, and the normalized Lode angle parameter \$\$\{{\textbackslash}bar {\textbackslash}theta\}\$\$. For a proportional loading, the fracture surface is shown to be an asymmetric function of \$\$\{{\textbackslash}bar {\textbackslash}theta\}\$\$. A detailed parametric study is performed to demonstrate the effect of model parameters on the fracture locus. It was found that the M–C fracture locus predicts almost exactly the exponential decay of the material ductility with stress triaxiality, which is in accord with theoretical analysis of Rice and Tracey (1969) and the empirical equation of Hancock and Mackenzie (1976), Johnson and Cook (1985). The M–C criterion also predicts a form of Lode angle dependence which is close to parabolic. Test results of two materials, 2024-T351 aluminum alloy and {TRIP} {RA}-K40/70 ({TRIP}690) high strength steel sheets, are used to calibrate and validate the proposed M–C fracture model. Another advantage of the M–C fracture model is that it predicts uniquely the orientation of the fracture surface. It is shown that the direction cosines of the unit normal vector to the fracture surface are functions of the “friction” coefficient in the M–C criterion. The phenomenological and physical sound M–C criterion has a great potential to be used as an engineering tool for predicting ductile fracture.},

Emphasis is placed on the incorporation of plastic strain effects into the probabilistic framework by approaching the strong influence of constraint variations on (macroscopic) cleavage fracture toughness in terms of the number of eligible Griffith-like microcracks which effectively control unstable crack propagation by cleavage. Some recent results based on a modified Weibull stress model to predict specimen geometry effects on Jc-values for pressure vessel grade steels are summarized in connection with an engineering procedure to calibrate the Weibull stress parameters. These results are compared against corresponding fracture toughness predictions derived from application of the standard Beremin model. Finally, the robustness of {LAF} methodologies, including specifically the Weibull stress approach, is critically examined along with a discussion of key issues and challenges related to engineering applications in fracture assessments of structural components.},

	abstract = {Avoidance of brittle fracture is a key issue of the integrity assessment of the nuclear reactor pressure vessels ({RPV}). The microstructural heterogeneities of these heavy components are in direct relation with the scatter of brittle fracture toughness. A microstructure informed brittle fracture ({MIBF}) model is used here to capture the effect of some microstructural features. This local approach type model is based on the Griffith criterion for brittle fracture applied to micro cracks nucleated on carbides. The size distribution of the cleavage initiators introduces a source of scatter for the fracture stress. The originality of the {MIBF} model is to introduce a second source of scatter: the stress distribution inside a representative aggregate of the bainitic microstructure. These stresses are the average for each bainitic packet of the maximum principal stresses. Their non-uniform distribution is due to the incompatibilities of plastic deformation introduced by crystallographic misorientations between packets. Finite elements simulations on aggregates representative of the steel bainitic microstructure are performed to identify the stress distributions. The size distribution of cleavage initiators is the carbide size distribution as the carbides cracking induced by plastic deformation is considered to be the main damage leading to cleavage propagation in {RPV} steel. The only free parameter of the model is the effective surface energy γf. Applied to the Euro fracture toughness dataset, the {MIBF} model predicts the specimen size effect on fracture toughness as well as the temperature dependence of the fracture toughness up to 200 {MPa}√m. The analysis of the numerical results shows that taking into account the incompatibility stresses widens the size range of carbides potentially implied in the fracture process. However, approximatively half of these carbides have still a size larger than the largest observed sizes underlining the importance to perform the determination of size distributions on a very large number of precipitates.},

	abstract = {Experiments were performed on three heats of A508 class 3 steel in order to determine the mechanical conditions for cleavage fracture. These tests were carried out on various geometries including 4-point bend specimens and axisymmetric notched tensile bars with different notch radii which have been modelized using the finite element method. In one heat, the temperature range investigated was from 77 K to 233 K. It is shown that the cleavage resistance is increased by tensile straining. Moreover, the probability of fracture obeys the Weibull statistical distribution. All the results can be accounted for in terms of a local criterion based on Weibull theory and which takes into account the effect of plastic strain. In this criterion, the parameters which were experimentally determined are found to be temperature independent over the range 77 K to 170 K. The applicability of the approach proposed for cleavage fracture at the crack tip is also examined. It is shown that the experimental results published in the literature giving the variation of fracture toughness with temperature can be explained by the proposed criterion which predicts reasonably well both the scatter in the experimental results and {theKICtemperature} dependence.},
