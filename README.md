The project `FailureCriteria` provides `MFront` implementations of
various criteria to estimate the risk of brittle and ductile failure.
Those implementations can be used in uncoupled analyses, in the
post-processing of the computations.

Available criteria
==================

Brittle failure
---------------

- Beremin (1993),
- Ruggieri and Dodds (2015),
- Forget, Marini and Vincent (2016)

Ductile failure
---------------

- Freudenthal (1950)
- Cockcroft and Latham (1968)
- Rice and Tracey (1969)
- Hancock and McKenzie (1976)
- Johnson And Cook (1985)
- Huang (1991)
- Bai and Wierzbicki (2010)
